# Cutecord
Cutecord is a [Powercord](https://powercord.dev) plugin that
makes Discord a bit cuter. Cutecord reimplements Discord's notification
logic so you can control who you get notifications from and when.

## cutecord is great for these reasons
- Allow notifications from specific users to bypass DND owo
- Block other users from your notifications entirely òwó
- Don't recieve notifications when you're invisible uwu
- Most of y'all cute :D (Except Spud D:<)

cutecord expects a comma separated list of snowflakes in it's
configuration. This isn't the most cutest way to set it up but
contributions to add better UI are welcome.

you can find cutecord wherever good things are sold or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/powercord-community/cutecord).
install as you would any other powercord plugin, with
`git clone` uwu
